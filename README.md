This repository contains examples of numerical methods to solve both partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. I plan on growing this repository as I find more interesting differential equations to solve or other interesting ways to solve them numerically. Currently I have the Lorenz ordinary differential equations solved using the Runge-Kutta method (2nd order). I also have the wave partial differential equation solved using finite differencing for a one dimensional string moving through time. All of these problems are solved in MATLAB and all figures in each of their respective folders have interesting graphics representing these fully solved differential equations.
